                Russell Westbrook came into the NBA in 2008 as an explosive athlete with limitless potential. 
                
                He was drafted fourth overall by the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he played with future MVPs Kevin Durant and James Harden. 
                
                However, Harden was traded to the Houston Rockets just a few years later, and Durant joined the Golden State Warriors after failing to win a championship in Oklahoma City. 
                
                Westbrook won the league MVP in 2017, but has bounced around the league ever since. 
                
                Hereâ€™s a brief timeline of his career.
